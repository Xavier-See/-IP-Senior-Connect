# 👴 Senior Connect: Non-Invasive Elderly Monitoring System

> **A smart, privacy-first safety net for elderly living alone.**

## 📖 About The Project
**Senior Connect** is a distributed IoT system designed to protect elderly residents living alone in Singapore. Unlike traditional monitoring systems that rely on intrusive CCTV cameras, Senior Connect uses a "Sensor Fusion" approach to detect emergencies (like falls or unconsciousness) without compromising the user's dignity or privacy.

Our system passively monitors critical zones (Bathroom, Living Room, Bedroom) and uses logic-based algorithms to distinguish between normal daily routines and potential emergencies.

### 🎯 Key Goals
* **Zero Cameras in Private Zones:** Uses environmental data (Humidity, Radar, Motion) instead of video.
* **Real-Time Safety:** Instantly alerts caregivers via Email upon detecting falls or abnormal inactivity.
* **Privacy First:** All processing is done locally on Raspberry Pi "Edge Nodes."

## ⚙️ System Architecture
The project is built on a **Distributed IoT Network** topology. Each room functions as an independent "Edge Node" that processes raw sensor data locally and transmits status updates to a Central Controller via **MQTT**.

### The "Sensor Suite"
* **Zone 1: Bathroom (The "Steam Logic")**
    * **Hardware:** DHT22 Humidity Sensor + PIR Motion Sensor + Proximity Sensor.
    * **Logic:** Detects active showering by tracking steam levels (>90% Humidity).
    * **Safety:** Triggers a **CRITICAL ALERT** if high humidity is detected but no motion occurs for >60 seconds (Potential unconscious fall).

* **Zone 2: Living Room (Activity Monitoring)**
    * **Hardware:** mmWave Radar + PIR Sensor + Pi Camera (Entrance only).
    * **Logic:** Monitors "Human Presence" even when the user is sitting still.
    * **Safety:** Triggers a wellness check if **No Motion** is detected for 2 hours while the user is home.

* **Zone 3: Bedroom (Vitals Tracking)**
    * **Hardware:** mmWave Radar (LD2410).
    * **Logic:** Tracks "In Bed" vs. "Out of Bed" status.
    * **Safety:** Monitors Heart Rate and Breathing Rate through blankets to detect health deterioration during sleep.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. "Steam Logic" Fall Detection
We solved the problem of monitoring wet bathrooms without cameras. By correlating the **Proximity Sensor** (Entry) with **Humidity Spikes** (Shower ON), the system knows when a fall is most likely to happen and tightens its safety thresholds accordingly.

### 2. Spam-Filtered Alerts
The Central Controller includes a "Cool-Down" logic to prevent alert fatigue. If a fall is detected, it suppresses duplicate emails for 60 seconds while continuing to log the event.

### 3. Automated Data Dashboard
Sensor logs are automatically written to a master Excel file (`SeniorConnect_MasterLog.xlsx`). A custom Python script pushes this file to a private GitHub repository every minute, ensuring the Workflow Team always has access to the latest health data without manual file transfers.
